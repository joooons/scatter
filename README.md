## How to use this app

- Have all players open [theloaflings.web.app](https://theloaflings.web.app/) on their own device.

- If you are unfamiliar with the app, you can click on the blinking red question mark object to see explanation for how the app works.

- When the app first loads, almost all functions are locked. Click on `SCATTERGORIES` to unlock the controls. The heading should change to a green bar with the word `UNLOCKED`.

- Click on `Word List` to see a menu of 8 different question prompt cards. Click on one of them to select that Word List card.

- For each Word List, there are 12 input fields, each of which has the category showing by default. Type anything into an input field to immediately replace the category with your answer submission. Deleting your answer to reveal the category again.

- The box with the `?` on the right represents the selected letter of the alphabet. This will be randomly selected for you when the game starts.

- Start the game by clicking on `START`. This will begin a timer countdown for all players with the app currently open.

- Before the countdown ends, enter your answer for each category. Your answer must begin with the letter showing on the letter box.

- After the countdown ends, click on `RESULTS` to see the answers submitted by every player.
